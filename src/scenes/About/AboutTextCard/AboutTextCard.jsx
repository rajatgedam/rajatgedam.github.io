        Based in <span className={s.purple}> Boston, USA, </span> 
        I'm a software engineer with expertise in full stack development{' '} 
        using React, .NET, Angular, Python. 
        <br />

        <br />
        I have successfully identified and resolved complex issues 🎯, often working collaboratively with team members to develop creative solutions that deliver results. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I have a Master's degree in Computer Science and I am currently working as a Software Engineer at UMass SMAST (Dean's Office). 🐳 
        <br /><br /> Currently, I am building a web application for tracking student degree progress. The back-end is facilitated with stored procedures on a Microsoft SQL Server. 
        The primary purpose of this application is reduce paperwork for the administrative team and reduce redunduncy in the data.📎
        <br /><br />
        Implemented AI 🤖 with Power BI to generate analytics 📊 and reports from graduate program data resulting in bird's eye view reports of all the students' current progress. 
        <br /><br />
        I previously worked for Yardi Systems, Santa Barbara, developing a co-working space management platform. (2018 - 2021) 
        <br /><br />
        At Yardi Systems, I tailored end-to-end solutions, from creating database schemas, tables, and developing <span className={s.purple}>REST APIs</span> to designing web pages for these services. In the <span className={s.purple}>AGILE</span> environment, I worked on implementating and maintaining new features, fixing bugs, defects and actively took part in code reviews.
        <br /><br />
        I used the frameworks .NET and Angular with tools such as <span className={s.purple}>Postman, Swagger, Confluence and JIRA</span> for the software development life cycle activites at Yardi Systems. 
        <br /><br />
        🚀 I am looking for new opportunities and I'm willing to relocate. <br /> <br />
        Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
